## Youtube Player

:::warning

This is an experimental feature.

:::

The react audio player is a component for native audio players but it is optimized to look the same in all browsers and have a great UI and is highly customized.
It consumes both the native browser event DOM api and the react event API making it fast.

## Usage

To use the react Youtube player component you have to import it from the `reactjs-media` module as `YoutubePlayer`

**Example**

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { YoutubePlayer } from "reactjs-media";

const MyVideo = () => {
	return (
		<>
			<ReactAudio
				src="https://youtu.be/UZCO5k1Nu70"
				width={650}
				height={600}
				//you can pass in other props
			/>
		</>
	);
};
```

## Props

List of the available props:

> **Note:** Since this is an experimental feature we recommend right clicking on the video inorder to get the video url instead of copying from the browser address bar. Both work but there are some issuses incase of page reloads.

| Prop              | Type                       | Description                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src`             | string: **Required**       | This represents the url of the video                     |
| `title`           | string: Optional           | This is needed to prevent iframe warning in the terminal |
| `allowFullScreen` | Boolean: Optional          | This will enable the fullsscreen button on the player    |
| `className`       | string: Optional           | The can be placed incase you want to use it              |

| `width`           | string or number: Optional | The max width of the player                              |
