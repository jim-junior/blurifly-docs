The video player has many props that can be used to impletment logic.

## `src`

-   The `src` prop is a string and it represents the source of the video being played. You should not that it is also a **required** prop so if your dont pass it in the component will throw an **error**.

**Example**

```jsx {4}
const Video = () => {
	return <div>
        <ReactVideo
        src="/Learn useCallback In 8 Minutes.mp4"
        poster="/uganda-smoke-flag-isolated-black-background-199119742.jpg"
    />
    <div>;
};
```

## `poster`

-   The `poster` prop is a string and it represents the poster of the video being played.

**Example**

```jsx {5}
const Video = () => {
	return <div>
        <ReactVideo
        src="/Learn useCallback In 8 Minutes.mp4"
        poster="/ASJDXJ.........XS.....42.jpg"
    />
    <div>;
};
```

## `type`

This represents the type of the video it usally defaults to `video/mp4`. the values expexted is a string.

## `onTimeUpdate`

This props is also passed down in form of a fuction. The function that your pass in will recieve three arguments and these are:

### event

This is a native browser event that is usally triggered each time the video time updates. It is the first argument you will receive

### currentTime

This is a the current time that the video playback has reached.

### duration

This is the full video duration. This is anded in just because we thought it was necessary.

```jsx {10}
const Video = () => {
    function onTimeUpdateProp(event, currentTime, duration) {
        // some logic is place here
    }

	return <div>
        <ReactVideo
        src="/Learn useCallback In 8 Minutes.mp4"
        ....
        onTimeUpdate={onTimeUpdateProp}
