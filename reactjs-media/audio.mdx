## Audio Player

The react audio player is a component for native audio players but it is optimized to look the same in all browsers and have a great UI and is highly customized.
It consumes both the native browser event DOM api and the react event API making it fast.

## Usage

To use the react audio player component you haveto import it r=from the `reactjs-media` module as `ReactAudio`

**Example**

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { ReactAudio } from "reactjs-media";

const MyVideo = () => {
	return (
		<>
			<ReactAudio
				src="/audio.mp4"
				poster="/poster.png"
				//you can pass in other props
			/>
		</>
	);
};
```

Your can also import the audio player from another file in the package.

```jsx
import { ReactAudio } from "reactjs-media/audio";
```

## Component Props

The package also has additional pros that your can pass throug is so that you can carry out some logic. A feww important ones will be listed here you can find the full list in the API section

### `src`

-   The `src` prop is a string and it represents the source of the audio being played. You should not that it is also a **required** prop so if your dont pass it in the component will throw an **error**.

**Example**

```jsx {4}
const Audio = () => {
	return <div>
        <ReactAudio
        src="/Learn useCallback In 8 Minutes.mp4"
    />
    <div>;
};
```

### `type`

This represents the type of the video it usally defaults to nothing. the values expexted is a string.

### `onTimeUpdate`

This props is also passed down in form of a fuction. The function that your pass in will recieve three arguments and these are:

-   #### `event`

This is a native browser event that is usally triggered each time the audio time updates. It is the first argument you will receive

-   #### `currentTime`

This is a the current time that the audio playback has reached.

-   #### `duration`

This is the full audio duration. This is anded in just because we thought it was necessary.

```jsx {10}
const Audio = () => {
    function onTimeUpdateProp(event, currentTime, duration) {
        // some logic is place here
    }

	return <div>
        <ReactAudio
        src="/Learn useCallback In 8 Minutes.mp4"
        ....
        onTimeUpdate={onTimeUpdateProp}
    />
    <div>;
};
```
