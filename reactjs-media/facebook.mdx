## Facebook Player

The Facebook player component is used to play facebook videos directly on your website using the facebook player API.

## Usage

To use the react Facebook player component you have to import it from the `reactjs-media` module as `FacebookPlayer`

## Example

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { FacebookPlayer } from "reactjs-media";

const MyVideo = () => {
	return (
		<>
			<FacebookPlayer
				src="https://www.facebook.com/facebook/videos/10153231379946729/"
				width={650}
				height={600}
			/>
		</>
	);
};
```


:::tip

You dont have to load the Facebook SDK into your `index.html` file. the player will load the script immediately after it mounts to the DOM.
